    <h2>Organizational Integrity: balancing turnover vs. longevity</h2>
    <h3>Storyline</h3>
    <p>
      Looking further at organizational dynamics
      reveals other things
      about the evolution of the IPCC.
      Designed as  self-governing institution,
      the IPCC essentially reproduces itself
      with everyone of its ARs;
      if we wanted to understand the institution,
      we might look rather at the 5 ARs
      as 5 different IPCCs,
      stitched together
      by an evolving set
      of procedures and rules,
      as well as a rotating cast
      of authors, chairmen,
      technical support units and Secretariat staff.
      It is impressive how the institution
      achieves its work
      with relatively light bureaucracy
      and voluntary coordination
      between hundreds of scientists.
      One of the informal elements
      that assures that
      “things hold together”
      is the repeat participation
      of authors from previous reports.
      At the same time,
      the institution officially encourages
      frequent turnover of its members
      to try and ensure
      a wider range of participation.
      This storyline looks at the interplay
      between roles and responsibilities
      of the authors,
      as well as their longevity in the institution.
      An analysis of the institution
      as network and self-regulatory organization
      but importance of experience
      in sustaining the functionality
      of its output.

    <h3>Questions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1) Who are the authors
        that have participated
        in more than 1,2,3 or 4 ARs?
      </li>
      <li>
        2) Who are the authors
        that have participated
        in more than 1,2,3 or 4 ARs
        while holding at least
        1 of the three elected roles
        in the IPCC
        in each AR
        (CLA, LA, RE)?
      </li>
      <li>
        11) What are the individual trajectories
        of those authors
        that have participated
        in over 14 chapters
        in the IPCC?
        How do these trajectories compare?
        Are there similar trends
        in terms of roles held;
        country of affiliation; etc?
      </li>
      <li>
        what are the differences between WGs
        of this phenomenon?
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      What does it mean to pass between ARs? [REPEAT Protocol Above]
    </p>
    <p>
      Build lists of these individuals
      (define each population; i.e = {>1 AR + CLA/LA/RE})
      and analyse:
    </p>
    <ul class="item">
      <li>Institutional affiliation (compared w/overall IPCC)</li>
      <li>Country affiliation (compared w/overall IPCC)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      How would we characterize these individuals?
    </p>
    <ul class="item">
      <li>
        Are these contributors more “interdisciplinarity”?
        <br/>
        Compare their “interdisciplinarity” measures
        with those of the total population of the IPCC
      </li>
      <li>
        Do they have more responsibility
        (compared w/overall IPCC)
      </li>
      <li>
        Do they have consistent participation
        within certain thematic domains?
        (i.e. are certain subjects
        more open to “longevity”;
        if so, which?)
