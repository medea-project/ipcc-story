    <h2>Networking National Science</h2>
    <h3>Storyline</h3>
    <p>
      Look at history of IPCC
      by looking in depth
      at a key country’s participation
      in the institution.
      In this case,
      we will look at the role
      France played from the institute’s inception
      and the relationship
      between French climate science funding
      and French scientific communities’ presence
      in the project of assessing climate change.
      Can we detect “national cultures”
      of climate science
      using the IPCC,
      and our databse of it,
      as a proxy?
      This story will be elaborated
      following both interviews
      with central French authors
      and reading secondary source documents
      on French climate science funding
      and lab development.
      Visualizations will focus
      on this list of French authors and institutions
      and their spread across the different WGs, and chapters
      as well as looking at the intersection
      of French authority
      with the hierarchy of the IPCC.

      It would be also of interest
      to include brief comparison
      of top-flight statistics w/another,
      similarly situated country
      (say between France and Germany or Belgium or Italy?)
      &mdash; just comparing data from database,
      not detailing the historical narrative,
      looking particularly at the chapter participation
      to show different specializations between countries
      &mdash; if actual.

    <h3>Questions</h3>
    <ul class="bullet">
      <li>
        What is the general picture
        of French Participation in the IPCC
        from the database
        <br/>
        <small>
        (# of participants;
        AR by AR;
        WG by WG;
        Role by Role;
        Chapter by Chapter;
        and Institutionally)
        </small>
      </li>
      <li>
        Who are those French authors w/repeat participation AR by AR?
      </li>
      <li>
        What role did they have in the leadership of the IPCC?
      </li>
      <li>
        What role did French authors have in defining
        the functioning of the IPCC;
        or say the creation of grounding principles
        like the SRES (A1B, etc)
      </li>
      <li>
        What can we say about a “French” expertise
        in climate leadership
        according to the IPCC record?
        Based on their chapter participation?
      </li>
      <li>
        How did participation in the IPCC
        affect the goals/organization of French climate science
        <br/>
        &mdash; particularly within the climate modeling community?
      </li>
      <li>
        How did French institutions of climate science
        change over this period
        (what is perhaps a process
        of deeper institutionalization of climate labs)?
        <br/>
        What about the geography
        of the French scientists and institutions?
        Paris and Toulouse for the most part?
      </li>
      <li>
        The French focal points and the IPCC
        <br/>
        &mdash; was there a “French touch” to the IPCC and the SPM?
      </li>
