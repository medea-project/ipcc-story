    <h1>Dynamic IPCC: An Organizational Perspective</h1>
    <h2>Introduction: The Rise of Assessments</h2>
    <p>
      The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is one the most
      visible, influential and complex institutions of modern science.
      Established by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)
      and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in 1988,
      the IPCC <q>reviews and assesses the most recent scientific,
      technical and socio-economic information</q>
      to provide <q>a clear scientific view
      on the current state of knowledge in climate change
      and its potential environmental and socio-economic impacts</q>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Given the stakes of the climate debate
      and the centrality of the IPCC in such debates,
      it’s crucial that its findings
      represent the broadest possible range
      of climate expertise.
      This need for representativeness
      is reflected, to a certain extent,
      in the composition and structure
      of the institution.
      Overseen by a very light hierarchy
      of rotating chairpersons and vice-chairs,
      the IPCC functions primarily
      thanks to the coordinated efforts
      of hundreds of experts
      working around the world.
      Despite this dispersed and networked structure,
      the IPCC retains a fairly “singular” voice
      thanks to its rules of consensus.
      This has created the impression
      that the institution is more monolithic
      than it actually is.
      Within the IPCC there is a rich world of movement&mdash;of
      turnover, longevity, shifting responsibilities
      and disciplinary bridging&mdash;by different contributors
      across 25 years of Assessment Reports.

      Much regard has been given
      to different rules that shape
      how the IPCC reports its findings,
      particularly the effects
      the rule of consensus has
      on this reporting
      (<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378012001215"
        >Brysse et al.,2013</a>).
      But less analysis has been done
      on the political and communication effects
      of the IPCC’s own structuring.
      So it came to us
      that we could actually map
      some aspects of this “inner-life”
      by following the individual participants
      of the IPCC over time.
      With this aim in mind,
      the médialab has constructed
      a novel database of all 4,390 individual IPCC authors
      over the last 5 Assessment Reports (ARs)
      including information on authors’ institutional affiliations,
      countries of origin, authorial roles
      and individual chapter participations.
      This database gives us the means
      to visualize the life and evolution of the institution,
      particularly in regard to
      specific social issues and international events
      that have marked the enterprise
      of climate change research.
