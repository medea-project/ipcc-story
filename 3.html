    <h2>Representation and Expertise</h2>
    <h3>Storyline</h3>
    <h4>I.</h4>
    <p>
      The IPCC is unlike any institution
      in the history of science
      or in the history of international affairs.
      For sheer number of participants
      (in the 1000s for each AR),
      scale of production time (5-7 years)
      and rigor of process,
      nothing like this has ever been tried before
      in the realm of scientific publication.
      Made all the more remarkable
      because the entire process
      if driven by volunteers scientists and researchers
      (who are nonetheless nominated and selected)
      and who are required to make enormous sacrifices
      over the course of their tenure as authors
      (but who also benefit from the prestige
      of being an IPCC author).
    </p>
    <p>
      By some regards,
      it has also been incredibly inclusive,
      counting over 125 countries
      who have provided scientists
      who participated in the Assessment Reports.
      That includes xx number of LDC; etc.
    </p>
    <h4>II.</h4>
    <p>
      Nonetheless,
      the IPCC remains an institution
      whose authorship is driven heavily
      by the presence and participation
      of researchers from a smaller group
      of 20 countries.
      It is not to detract at all
      from the institution
      to remark that 90% of its authors
      come from a limited number of countries.
      This is a general reflection
      of the nature of climate science
      &mdash; particularly the physical science,
      which relies on large state laboratories
      which can only be funded by
      states with significant resources.

      <li>Rules of IPCC and procedures</li>
      <li>
        An important factor to consider
        in assessing how well IPCC operating procedures
        match its principle goal of producing
        high quality, consensus documents,
        its to consider that other goals
        of the organization
        might work at cross purposes
        to this first priority goal.
        For instance, positive discrimination
        within the selection of lead authors
        most certainly has
        short and long-term positive effects
        in terms of establishing
        a more inclusive and diverse assessment,
        which certainly increases
        the legitimacy of the process
        in the eyes of governments
        with small pools of potential contributors.
        But this type of discrimination
        may produce additional effects
        that need to be compensated for
        through informal means
        (the appointment and reaching out by CLA's
        to Contributing Authors
        &mdash; a discretionary category of authors),
        and these informal means
        are difficult to discuss
        or codify in IPCC procedures,
        but worth bringing to light
        in a study of IPCC norms

    <h3>Questions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        6) How does the geographic diversity
        of IPCC authors change over time?
        Is there a rise overtime in participation
        of authors from South America compared to Asia?
      </li>
      <li>
        8) Which LDC (Least Developed Countries)
        are the most present in the IPCC?
        In which WGs?
      </li>
      <li>
        9) In which chapters
        do authors from Africa
        participate in?
        Is there variation
        between African country participation?
      </li>
      <li>
        10) What is the ratio
        of African CLA vs LA vs RE vs CA authors?
      </li>
      <li>
        13) Which countries
        have increased their participation in the IPCC
        and which have decreased over time?
      </li>
      <li>
        15) What are the differences in diversity
        (by country and by institution)
        between the working groups?

        and the Executive Director of the UNEP (M.K. Tolba)</cite>
         address the concern of diversity
        in their description of the IPCC:
        <q>The panel also established a Special Committee
        on the Participation of Developing Countries
        to promote, as quickly as possible,
        the full participation of developing countries
        in its activities.</q>
        From the very beginning,
        there was an explicit politics
        of trying to include developing country authors
        in as much of the reports as possible.
