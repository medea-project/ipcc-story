    <h2>Coordination, Consensus and Controversy</h2>
    <h3>Storyline</h3>
    <h4>I.</h4>
    <p>
      On January 20, 2010,
      the Guardian’s Fred Pearce (Pearce, 2010)
      published an article
      identifying a number of errors
      within the AR4 of the IPCC.
      The errors were almost entirely contained
      in the WG2 volume of the AR,
      and included most notably the assertion
      that the Himalayan glaciers were expected to melt by 2035,
      that 55% of the Netherlands was below sea-level
      and thus vulnerable to climate impacts
      (26% of the country is below sea-level)<a
        href="#note1"><sup>1</sup></a>
      and that increasing dryness in the Amazonian basin
      due to rising emissions
      would create increased likelihood of massive,
      uncontrollable fires
      that would decimate the rainforest and its species.
      Pearce, in this initial article
      entertained the notion ripe among climate deniers
      that the WG2 authors had perhaps exaggerated
      the impacts of climate change in the report
      out of their own self-interest
      in securing more research money.
      Pearce’s article was quickly followed
      by a number of other articles in the press,
      and very quickly the IPCC was dealing
      with its very own Himalayagate and Amazongate.<a
        href="#note2"><sup>2</sup></a>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <sup id="note1">1</sup>
      <p>
        The inquiry was triggered
        by widespread media coverage
        of two errors in the IPCC report:
        claims that all Himalayan glaciers might melt by 2035
        (glaciologists say they are unlikely to melt so quickly)
        and that more than 55% of the Netherlands lies below sea level
        (the real figure is 26%).
        In April, the Dutch minister for the environment at the time,
        Jacqueline Cramer,
        commissioned the PBL
        to reassess the reliability
        of the IPCC's regional projections.
        The PBL then double-checked
        with the IPCC's coordinating lead authors
        all statements in relevant chapters that seemed unclear,
        unfounded or inconsistent.
      </p>
      <p>
        This process has uncovered nothing
        that would undermine the IPCC's main conclusions,
        or the Dutch's government's plans
        for adapting to climate impacts,
        including sea-level rise,
        says Hajer.
        Ironically, the Dutch sea-level error
        derived from the PBL's own figures,
        which has caused embarrassment.
        "My authors were certainly bemused
        to find themselves interviewed by PBL about their work
        when actually it was PBL
        that provided the wrong information
        which caused the furore in the first place,"
        says Martin Parry,
        a visiting professor at Imperial College London
        and former co-chair of Working Group II.
      </p>
      <p>
        / In 32 projected regional impacts
        highlighted in the IPCC report's
        'Summary for Policy-makers',
        the PBL found only one factual error.
        The number of Africans
        projected to be exposed to water shortage
        due to climate change,
        stated as 75 million to 250 million people,
        should be 90 million to 220 million.
      </p>
      <p>
        / Elsewhere in the IPCC report,
        a predicted 50–60% decrease
        in the productivity of anchovy fisheries
        was erroneously derived
        from an unrelated study
        projecting a 50–60% decrease
        in extreme wind and ocean turbulence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other errors include a handful
        of incorrect references, table titles and typos.

      This might not have been such the crisis
      it turned out to be for the IPCC
      were it not following closely on the heals
      of another well-timed piece of press-baiting
      provided by the hacking
      of the Climate Research Unit
      of East Anglia University’s email repository
      a couple months earlier (November 17, 2009).
      This hack-job revealed a biting, inside look
      at how some of the leading climate researchers in the world,
      particularly Phil Jones (the head of the CRU)
      and Michael Mann (the originator of the famous hockey-stick graph
      correlating historical CO2 emissions
      and with a rising temperature record),
      described their research
      and also talked about the research of people
      generally considered climate change skeptics
      (cf. Who Was Emailing Who graph).
      A number of skeptics
      had been hot on the trail of Mann,
      trying to falsify his “hockey-stick” findings,
      and were demanding
      both access to data and access to emails.
      Some of the discussion about in the email
      about how Mann used a “trick”s
      to produce the graph
      generated an immense uproar
      (which many scientists understood
      to be a fabricated uproar)
      about this notion of using “tricks”
      to make data say certain things
      rather than others.
      Of course the notion of “trick”,
      when put in its context,
      is an absolutely run of the mill way
      of talking about different treatments of data,
      but the timing
      of what people were then calling “Climategate”
      was in the weeks leading up
      to the UN Copenhagen Summit on Climate Change,
      and the revelations had a disastrous impact
      on the credibility of climate science
      for a brief window of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following on the heals of Climategate,
      the new claims by some loud voices in the press
      about errors in the IPCC
      did not ultimately reveal
      any wrong-doings or bad scientific assessment
      in the case of the Panel,
      but it did reveal some serious dysfunction
      in the way the IPCC operated,
      particularly between WGs.
      The errors identified by the entrepreneuring Peabody
      were all errors
      that had already been identified by IPCC authors themselves
      following the publication of AR4,
      but had remained largely ignored
      by an uninterested press corps and,
      because the Panel didn’t have a procedure
      to correct the errors,
      stayed in the pages of the already approved AR.
    </p>
    <h4>II.</h4>
    <p>
      It is important to know that these errors,
      by and large, were all isolated to WG2.
      And what is more interesting
      for the historian of science
      or sociologist of organizations
      is that this scandal revealed
      two significant things:
      a difference in the “scientific cultures”
      (epistemic cultures &mdash; Knorr-Cetina)
      of the different Working Groups
      and the absence of formalized rules
      to deal with the crises
      that this difference created
      in the overall institution.
    </p>
    <ul class="bullet">
      <li>
        Scandal reminds me similarly
        of the uproar caused
        by the Danish cartoons of Mahommed
        or the crude film about Mohammed’s life
        that unleashed the attacks
        on the US embassies in Cairo and Benghazi.
        The material had already existed for some time
        already on the web
        before it was seized upon
        by individuals or a community
        that found offense.
      </li>
      <li>
        These typographical or citation errors
        continue to serve as talking points
        among many conservatives
        to discredit, or cast doubt,
        on the overall product of the IPCC
        <br/>
        (see recent New Atlantis article by Lee).
      </li>
      <li>
        These errors launched
        a major review of the institution
        and a major soul-searching
        after the IPCC suffered
        a huge and unanticipated back-lash in the press
        for not being credible.
        The UN launched the IAC Review,
        which concluding in August of 2010
        found no deliberate wrong-doing
        on behalf of the institution
        and vindicated its work
        as rigorous and of highest order.
        At the same time,
        the IAC recommended the following changes
        to how the institution operated:
        <ul class="item">
          <li>x</li>
          <li>y</li>
          <li>z</li>
        </ul>
        These changes were all been adopted.
      </li>
      <li>
        If we come back to this notion of coordination...
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>III.</h4>
    <p>
      The concept of the Working Group
      is a major organizing principle
      of the IPCC’s Assessment Reports.
      If we look closely at the relationship
      between author participation
      and the overall social structure of the ARs,
      we see that this principle
      holds remarkably true
      &mdash; there is very little cross over
      by authors between the different WGs.
    </p>
    <ul class="bullet">
      <li>
        The IPCC has no rules
        excluding being present
        in more than one chapter or WG
        in any given AR,
        or in being in more than one AR
        (see the story Organizational Integrity).
        In fact, there is a LOT of participation overall
        by authors in multiple chapters
        within any given AR,
        as well as repetition across ARs.
        <br/>
        WHAT ARE THESE FIGURES
      </li>
      <li>
        But cross over activity,
        or bridging between WGs,
        remains rather rare.
        And when it happens
        (except for a couple exceptions
        like Linda O. Mearns, Michael Pratter and Tim Carter),
        it happens due to an author’s own volition.
        Perhaps the barriers to this bridging
        are rather obvious:
        the WGs delineate
        if not strictly different disciplinary fields,
        the questions each WG tries to answer
        implicate for different domains of expertise,
        whereas within a WG,
        the questions and culture of science
        are more similar across chapters.
        So if “bridging” is the exception
        rather than the rule,
        what brings it about
        and what function does it serve?
      </li>
      <li>
        We can analytically pose a few ideas already
        about bridging and what facilitates it.
        Perhaps there are certain subjects,
        which are treated in more than one WG
        and thus are relevant to be taken up
        by the same person in both domains
        (take sea level rise modeling
        and its implications on human populations).
        Or perhaps the individual “bridge” author
        is themselves endowed with a level of,
        for lack of a better word
        lets say “interdisciplinarity”,
        that allows them to bridge domains
        (Cynthia Rosensweig).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The IPCC operates from the stance of being
      <q>policy relevant, not policy perscriptive</q>;
      <cite>according to Silke Beck</cite>,
      occupying this stance
      is premised by a belief
      in a <q>linear-model</q>
      of the role of scientific expertise
      in the policy process.
      One a consensus is reached yb the scientists,
      then their conclusions can influence
      (and ideally resolve)
      the policy process.
      She argues that the linear model
      is not just naïve,
      but that it undermines
      the credibility of the institution
      in a time
      when different <q>virtual publics</q>
      are demanding
      for more transparency and accountability.
      Beck explicitly calls for a <q>reasoning together model</q>
      that <q>bridges cultural styles</q>
      &mdash; a reflexive, co-production process
      of legitimaging scientific knowledge.
