    <h3>Storyline</h3>
    <p>

        <q>The methodology developed here
        contributes to a growing scholarship
        examining the structure and organization
        of the IPCC
        using scientometric analysis.
        It is noteworthy however,
        that to our knowledge,
        no other studies have used
        publishing history of chapter authors
        to a priori identify expertise of authors
        and with the aim of informing
        the assessment process as it evolves.</q>

        If we have more interdisciplinary,
        we will also increase the ability
        of political deciders
        to respond to the calls of science
        that we need to act on climate change.
